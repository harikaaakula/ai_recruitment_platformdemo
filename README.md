## 🔄 Candidate Application Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Candidate Uploads Resume
- **Frontend**: File upload form at `/apply`
- **Validation**: PDF files only, max size check
- **Action**: POST to `/api/applications/apply`

#### 2. Resume Text Extraction
- **Backend**: Multer receives file, saves to `backend/uploads/`
- **PDF Parsing**: `pdf-parse` library extracts text
- **Fallback**: If parsing fails, uses filename + mock content

#### 3. AI Analysis
- **Primary**: OpenRouter API with DeepSeek model
- **Prompt**: Structured JSON extraction of:
  - Years of experience
  - Skills, knowledge, tasks
  - Education level
  - Certifications
  - Job titles
- **Fallback**: Pattern-based extraction using regex if AI fails

#### 4. Resume Parsing Details

**Education Extraction:**
```javascript
// Extracts full degree name, not just "Bachelor's"
Pattern: /bachelor[^\n|]*/i
Result: "Bachelor of Science in Information Technology – Cybersecurity Focus"
```

**Certification Extraction:**
```javascript
// Deduplicates certifications using Set
Patterns: {
  'CompTIA Security+': /CompTIA\s+Security\+/gi,
  'CEH': /Certified\s+Ethical\s+Hacker|(?<!\w)CEH(?!\w)/gi,
  'CISSP': /(?<!\w)CISSP(?!\w)/gi,
  // ... more patterns
}
Result: ["CompTIA Security+", "CEH"] // No duplicates
```

**Skills Extraction:**
- Matches against job's required skills list
- Case-insensitive matching
- Returns array of matched skills

#### 5. AI Scoring
- **Matching Engine**: `backend/services/matchingEngine.js`
- **Calculation**:
  - Skill Match: (matched_skills / required_skills) × skill_weight
  - Knowledge Match: (matched_knowledge / required_knowledge) × knowledge_weight
  - Task Match: (matched_tasks / required_tasks) × task_weight
  - Experience Match: Bonus/penalty based on years
  - Final Score: Weighted sum of all components

#### 6. Application Creation
- **Database Insert**: Creates records in:
  - `candidates` table (if new)
  - `applications` table with status
  - `ai_analysis` table with scores and extracted data
- **Status Determination**:
  - `eligible`: AI score ≥ job threshold (typically 60-70%)
  - `not_eligible`: AI score < threshold

#### 7. Skill Test (If Eligible)
- **Test Assignment**: System generates test based on job category
- **Question Selection**: 
  - Maps candidate's claimed skills to test questions
  - Selects 4-10 questions covering different skills
  - Multiple choice format
- **Test Taking**: Candidate answers questions
- **Scoring**: Percentage of correct answers

#### 8. Skill Verification
- **Process**: For each claimed skill:
  - Find questions that test that skill
  - Calculate: (correct_answers / total_questions) × 100
  - **Verified**: ≥70% correct
  - **Unverified**: <70% correct
  - **Untested**: No questions available
- **Storage**: Results saved in `tests` table as JSON

#### 9. Final Status Update
- **Status**: Changed to `test_completed`
- **Composite Score**: Calculated using weighted formula
- **Dashboard Update**: New data immediately available

#### 10. Data Propagation
All views update automatically:
- ✅ Recruiter dashboard shows new application
- ✅ Job-specific page includes new candidate
- ✅ Candidate profile displays complete analysis
- ✅ Skill insights update with new data

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Python 3.x (only if regenerating data)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sampleproject
```

#### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

#### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create `backend/.env` file (copy from `.env.example`):
```bash
cd ../backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and configure:
```env
PORT=5001
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here

# AI Provider (optional - works with mock by default)
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Get free key from openrouter.ai
MODEL_NAME=deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free

APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Note**: The system works without an API key using pattern-based extraction. For better accuracy, get a free OpenRouter API key from https://openrouter.ai/keys

#### 5. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

Backend will start on http://localhost:5001

#### 6. Start Frontend Server
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Frontend will start on http://localhost:3000

#### 7. Login as Recruiter

**Default Credentials:**
- Email: `recruiter@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Verification

After starting both servers:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Login"
3. Use recruiter credentials
4. You should see the dashboard with 1,086 applications

- Run `npm install` in frontend directory
- Clear `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`

### Database errors
- Database file should exist at `backend/database/recruitment.db`
- Check file permissions
- If corrupted, regenerate from CSV data

### Resume upload fails
- Check `backend/uploads/` directory exists
- Verify file is PDF format
- Check file size (max 10MB)

### AI extraction not working
- System falls back to pattern-based extraction automatically
- Check console logs for AI errors
